# Knowledge Base

Nowadays it's very easy to learn anything online. You just have to google the topic you want and there you go. You have access to thousands of resources. For example there are great courses on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) or similar websites. Use those resources, they are awesome!

There are two pages which you will visit a lot (and you probably know them very well already):

 - [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
 - [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

The relevant parts of these websites will be included at the end of every subsections.


In this page we try to collect some resources which are not the ones mentioned above and can help you to get into various topics. These can be tutorials, youtube chanels or any other websites.


## The Basics of HTML & CSS

First of all, you have to learn the fundamentals of HTML & CSS. The most important thing to understand is how you can create complex layouts. You have to have a good understanding of the basics, otherwise you will waste a lot of time when you debug some CSS magic...
To learn this, check out the following blog posts:

 - [The Basics of HTML and CSS - Part I.](http://blog.edmdesigner.com/the-basics-of-html-and-css-part-one/)
 - [The Basics of HTML and CSS - Part II.](http://blog.edmdesigner.com/the-basics-of-html-and-css-part-two/)

By finishing this part, you should be able to answer at least the following questions:

 - How can you put divs next to each other? (Think about two different solutions.)
 - How can you create a 3 row layout, where there are 3 columns in the middle row?
 - What is a clear class?
 - How can you create a top menubar which will hover in from the top when you scroll down?

## JS Basics

The first and most important thing to learn when you learn a programming language is the basic concepts. It's especially true when it comes to javascript. There are many developers who are confused about some of the basic concepts in the language. If you learn the basic principles, you will be much better js coder than those who know many frameworks but use javascript as it was a different language.

In this part let's focus on ES5, so you will gain a solid knowledge before you investigate the great (and not so great) things in ES6.

I started a [blog about JS](http://www.jsmage.com/) a few years ago. Unfortunately I stopped publishing posts on it, but I think these articles will be very useful for you:

 - [Variables and types](http://www.jsmage.com/2013/08/the-very-basics-variables-types-and.html)
 - [Objects](http://www.jsmage.com/2013/08/the-very-basics-objects-in-javascript.html)
 - [Arrays](http://www.jsmage.com/2013/08/the-very-basics-arrays-in-javascript.html)
 - [Functions](http://www.jsmage.com/2013/08/the-very-basics-functions-in-javascript.html)
 - [Function Scoping](http://www.jsmage.com/2013/09/the-very-basics-common-mistake-around.html)
 - [Function Combination](http://www.jsmage.com/2013/08/function-composition.html)
 - [The Module Pattern](http://www.jsmage.com/2014/01/the-module-pattern-in-javascript.html)

By finishing this part, you should be able to answer the following questions:

 - What types are there in Javascript?
 - How can you determine the dynamic type of a variable?
 - What is variable and function hoisting?
 - What is a closure?
 - What is a factory method?

## Prototypes, Inheritance and the Misterious 'this' Keyword

There are NO classes in Javascript. One of the biggest common mistakes is that coders coming from other languages try to use JS as a classical object oriented language. This is a prototype based object oriented language, not a classical one.

Actually I came to the conclusion that you don't even need to use the *this* and the *new* keyword in Javascript. It's a decision that I don't use some of the features in this language, BUT you need to know the fundamentals! If you know them you can decide wether you use something or not. That is why I am going to include some good articles about prototypes and prototype based inheritance a little bit later. (//TODO)

Also, I am going to get you a great article about the *this* keyword and related things. (bind, apply & call) (//TODO)

 


## Git

Git is a widely used versioning system. I wrote a blogpost about a branching model previously that contains lots of useful links to learning resources.

 - [Git Branching Workflows in SaaS Development and the Reivew ASAP Policy](http://blog.edmdesigner.com/git-branching-workflows-in-saas-development-and-the-review-asap-policy/)

If you follow the links in the article, you will be able to learn a lot about Git. After doing it, you should know:

 - the basic git commands: pull, commit, push, checkout, branch, etc...
 - the basic branching models / workflows


## HTML5 & CSS3

If you are already familiar with the basics, you should check out a [tutorial](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/building-html5-css-webpages/) which focuses on the modern but stable things.


## Javascript & the DOM

//TODO


## Linux

If you don't want to suffer as a developer, you definitely should use Linux. One of the biggest reasons is that it has a great package manager and a good default terminal, so you can easily run scrips which will help your day-to-day life. It is not very easy to find a good linux tutorial, but this seems to be okay: [http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/](http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/)


## Tooling & Task Automation

 - grunt, gulp, etc

 - [HTML Email Development Tools](http://blog.edmdesigner.com/tag/html-email-development-tools/)



## HTML Frameworks & CSS Precompilers

The second step is to get familiar with a framework. The most famous one - which you probably know - is Bootstrap (LINK) by Twitter. You can use it together with Font Awesome (LINK) to create decent UIs. It's best if you want to create admin UIs. For product end-user facing interfaces, you will need to use pure CSS knowledge.
