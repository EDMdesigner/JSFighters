JSFighters is a place where you mentor others by giving them challenging quests and valuable feedback in your open source projects.

Our mission is to give something back to the community. If you have learnt something, you should definitely share it with others. First of all, it speeds up the personal/professional development of another human being, secondly it helps you to improve yourself as well. That is why JSFighters was born.


At the moment we are a bunch of enthusiastic JS lovers, who love to teach and help. We believe that in a long run we can build a world-wide community where mentors and mentees can find each other and they can work together on meaningful open source projects.

Our goal is to train production-ready juniors. Throughout this process, both sides get to know each other and they can build good personal and professional relationships at the same time.


## How Does it Work?

Mentors (Jedies and Jedi masters) at JSFighters publish "quests" related to open source projects. They indicate what knowledge is needed to solve the quest and what you can learn from it.

Mentees can sign up for the quests. They will get valuable feedback from the mentors. When the mentor is satisfied with the result, he/she will merge the changes to the open source repository.


This way students benefit in two ways: they get feedback on their work and they contribute to open source repositories.

Mentors also benefit in two ways: few extra tasks will be solved related to their projects and they will improve their teaching skills.


## How to Apply?

First of all, fork the [JSFighters repository on Github](https://github.com/EDMdesigner/JSFighters). Figure out how to add yourself as a member. After you added yourself, open a pull request with a short description why you want to join. Please also provide some contact info, at least an email address. (If you are not familiar with git, please go to the knowledge base and research it.)

You may be contacted before the pull request is accepted.

After all of this, join the [JSFighters slack channel](https://jsfighters.slack.com/) and introduce yourself in the general channel. The main communication channel is slack.
