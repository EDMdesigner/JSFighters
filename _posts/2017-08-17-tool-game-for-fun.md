It's a good practice to create a small tool or game, using only Javascript and DOM manipulation. You can even start it with a bare html file.

Some ideas for the tool / game:

  - todo list
  - game of life
  - wall breaker game
  - tetris
  - minesweeper
  - etc

If you create something cool, you definitely should include that in your personal page. You can also host a game like this on GH pages.

When you finish the game/tool, you can try two more things:

 - save the state of the program to local storage, so the next time you reload the page, it will continue from where you left it.
 - create a chrome extension out of your program!
