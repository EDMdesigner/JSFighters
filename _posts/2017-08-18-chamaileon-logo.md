## New Chamaileon Logo Variations

If you come up with new logo variations, that's awesome. There are two things in my mind which would be very cool:

 - a variation which we could use as a loading icon. It could be part of the UI or a separate splash screen
   - an idea is that it changes its colors from time to time
   - or the @ sign could do a similar motion which you can see in google products: ![](https://thomas.vanhoutte.be/miniblog/wp-content/uploads/light_blue_material_design_loading.gif)
 - a variation for a 404 page would be also awesome. I don't have any idea for this, so you have to use your imagination. :)

## Demo page

If you want to show off how cool variation you created, then you definitely should create a demo page (on GH Pages) so you can show it to your friends, include it in your CV, etc. Use the /doc folder variation for the hosting.
