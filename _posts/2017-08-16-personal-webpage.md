First of all, you definitely should create a personal website which you host on Github Pages. JSFighters' website also works in the very same way. You can put anything there, but I suggest you to create a professional page which shows the world how great you are. ;)

Needed knowledge:

 - [HTML & CSS Basics][html-css]
 - [Jekyll][templating-langs]

[html-css]: /knowledge-base/#the-basics-of-html--css
[templating-langs]: /knowledge-base/#templating-languages--blogs
[js-basics]: /knowledge-base/#js-basics
[dom-basics]: /knowledge-base/#javascript--the-dom---the-basics
