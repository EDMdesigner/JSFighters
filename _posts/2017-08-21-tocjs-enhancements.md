There is a tiny, tiny repository called [tocjs](https://github.com/EDMdesigner/tocjs). You can create table of contents based on the h1...h6 elements in the dom. It also checks if the structure of the heading elements is correct. For example h3 should come after a h2, but not a h1. You can see it in action on our [blog.](https://blog.edmdesigner.com/the-basics-of-html-and-css-part-two/)

## TocJS Bugfix

There is a small bug in this program. If you refresh the page, then the highlighting will be on the first element in the list, not the actual one. If you figured out why it happens and you fixed it, that would be great. Just open a pull request.

## TocJS Demo Page

Just like any other small project, this one deserves a small demo page as well. (Hosted on GH Pages.) :)
