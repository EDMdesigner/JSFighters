Similarly to the [Chamaileon Logo Quest](/quest/open-source/2017/08/18/chamaileon-logo.html) you can create a kickass logo for JSFighters! Definitely go for SVG with some interaction and some animation.

When you are done with the kickass logo, create a demo page on ghpages! The /doc folder will be great for that.
